# **Levis**

Intelligent voice speaker Demo project on Raspberry Pi 4B+

## Introduction:

This demo *runs&&compile* on a *raspberry pi 4B+*. This demo can be used for phonological wake-up, and the wake-up word is "Xiao Le Xiao Le" in Chinese. After waking up, you can ask it to play music, set the alarm, adjust the volume, and chat with it.

*I hope that this open source project can evolve into a smart voice speaker system platform with a demo. Hope that interested people will work together to make it a top learning project.Welcome friends who are interested to join us.*

**Note:**

### Test whether the sound card can be used

```

#It will capture sound on AC108 and save as a.wav
arecord -Dac108 -f S32_LE -r 16000 -c 8 a.wav
#Take care of that the captured mic audio is on the first 6 channels
 
#It will play sound file a.wav on AC101
aplay -D ac101 a.wav
#Do not use -D plughw:1,0 directly except your wave file is single channel only.
 
#Doing capture && playback the same time
arecord -D hw:1,0 -f S32_LE -r 16000 -c 8 to_be_record.wav &
#mono_to_play.wav is a mono channel wave file to play
aplay -D plughw:1,0 -r 16000 mono_to_play.wav

```

### Install LED-related libraries
```

sudo apt-get -y install python-pip
sudo pip install pyusb
sudo pip install spidev
sudo pip install gpiozero

```

### Modify the source code

Communicating with TTS and ASR servers requires modifications to the source code.

#### 1.Developer account application
* visit website https://voice.lenovomm.com/voicePlatform/welcome/index.html
* Register an account on the official website, and obtain the Lenovo key AK and security key SK in the developer account page.

![ASR TTS key](art_picture/ASR_TTS_key.png)

#### 2.Modify file (Levis/frame_work/frame_work_common_def.h)
```

// Modify the macro, According to your key
#define LENOVOKEY_FRAMEWORK "lenovoKey: XXXXXXXXX"  
#define SECRETKEY_FRAMEWORK "secretKey: XXXXXXXXX" 

// if your Lenovo key AK is 123456, Modify the macro LENOVOKEY_FRAMEWORK.
#define LENOVOKEY_FRAMEWORK "lenovoKey: 123456"
// if your security key SK is abcdef, Modify the macro SECRETKEY_FRAMEWORK.
#define SECRETKEY_FRAMEWORK "secretKey: abcdef"
```

sudo su    
bash framework_start.sh

```

###  If an error is reported during runtime. 'Failed to find mixer element'
Use alsamixer to view sound card seeed8micvoicec information  
1. Command line input: alsamixer 
2. Press F6
![alsamixer info one ](art_picture/alsamixer_info_one.png)
3. Select the sound card "seeed-8mic-voicecard". 
![alsamixer info two ](art_picture/alsamixer_info_two.png)
4. View the item name. (speaker && headphone && DAC)
![alsamixer info three ](art_picture/alsamixer_info_three.png)

5. According to information modify macro definition in Levis/frame_work/framework_volume_ctl.h
![volume ctl ](art_picture/volume_ctl.png)

### If an error is reported during running. "snd_pcm_drain: Assertion 'pcm' failed."
```

Respeaker_Framework_Main: pcm.c:1282: snd_pcm_drain: Assertion 'pcm' failed.
framework_start.sh line 8: 1876 Aborted  (core dumped) ./Respeaker_Framework_Main

```
1. Check to see if there are other programs using the sound card.  
2. If another program uses a sound card, kill the process.

Start up and run program after power on
--------------------------------
If you want to self-starting the program after powering on the device.

```

0. sudo su 
1. sudo cp /etc/rc.local /etc/rc.local_bak
2. sudo nano /etc/rc.local
3. Add the following && Before exit 0.

yourpath='/home/pi/Levis/runonboard'
cd $yourpath
chmod 777 $yourpath/framework_start.sh
chmod 777 $yourpath/self_start.sh
sh $yourpath/self_start.sh

```

## Description of music playing module
At present, the demo can only play music locally.  
The way to access and play music on the Internet is temporarily unavailable due to the experimental environment.  
We hide the PARAMETERS and URL of the HTTP header.  

**Note:**

Currently only MP3 format is supported.You can add your own codec to support more formats.

MP3 files must be of high quality MP3 format.

* Levis/local_music Storing music files
The music file is named as follows.

```

artist_songname.mp3
songname.mp3
songname_artist.mp3
```

* The macro definition in the Levis/frame_work/frame_work_common_def.h  
```
#define PLAY_LOCAL_MUSIC (1)  //  1:local 0:online  Currently only local music can be played. Online access to music environment is not available because it is a test environment.
```
* The macro definition in the Levis/frame_work/play_audio.h
```
#define LOCAL_MUSIC_PATH "../local_music"  //  Can be modified to your own path
```

How to use the speaker
-----------------------------------

1. Wake up speaker
*  Say wake-up word "Xiao Le Xiao Le" in Chinese. 
2. Say command after wake up.
*  Set Clock.  You can say. "Yi Fen Zhong Hou Jiao Wo Chi Fan." in Chinese .
*  Chat with speaker. You can say. "How's the weather today" in chinese. Of course you can chat with it and say anything.
*  Play Music. You can say. "Play Little Apple" in Chinese. Of course you can make it play any song as long as there is this song in the library.
*  Stop playing song. You can say. "Stop play" in chinese.  Currently it can only stop playing, not pause playing.
*  Set the volume. You can say. "Tiao Gao Yin Liang " or "Tiao Di Yin Liang" in Chinese.
